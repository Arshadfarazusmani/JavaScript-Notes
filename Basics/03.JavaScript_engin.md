# JavaScript engine 

A JavaScript engine is a program that directly executes JavaScript code. It's the core component that takes the human-readable code written by developers and translates it into machine-level instructions that a computer's CPU can understand and execute.

Here's a breakdown of how a JavaScript engine generally works:

`Parsing`: The engine first parses the source code, converting it into a structured representation called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST is a tree-like data structure that represents the syntactic structure of the code.

`Interpretation`: An interpreter then takes the AST and converts it into bytecode, a low-level representation of the code. The interpreter executes the code line by line, which allows for a fast start-up time.

`Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation`: Modern JavaScript engines use a technique called JIT compilation to improve performance. The JIT compiler monitors the code as it runs and identifies "hot spots"â€”parts of the code that are executed frequently. It then compiles this code into highly optimized, faster machine code.

`De-optimization`: If the JIT compiler's assumptions about the code's behavior (e.g., data types) turn out to be wrong, the engine can "de-optimize" the machine code and revert to a less-optimized version. This ensures correct execution while still benefiting from optimization when possible.

`Memory Management`: The engine includes a call stack, which manages the execution context of functions, and a memory heap, where objects and dynamic data are stored. It also has a garbage collector that automatically reclaims memory that is no longer being used.

## Major JavaScript Engines
Each major browser and runtime environment uses its own JavaScript engine:

`V8`: Developed by Google, V8 powers Google Chrome, other Chromium-based browsers like Microsoft Edge and Brave, and the Node.js and Deno runtimes. It is known for its high performance.

`SpiderMonkey`: Developed by Mozilla, SpiderMonkey is the engine used in Firefox. It was the first-ever JavaScript engine, originally created by Brendan Eich.

`JavaScriptCore`: Developed by Apple, this engine is used in the Safari browser and the Bun runtime.

`Chakra`: A JavaScript engine initially developed by Microsoft for Internet Explorer and earlier versions of Edge. It has since been replaced by V8 in the Chromium-based version of Edge.

The V8 is Google's open-source, high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is a crucial component of Google Chrome, Node.js, and many other applications and frameworks.
