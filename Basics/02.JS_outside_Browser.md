# What is JavaScript?
JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

# Run  JavaScript  Outside  the Browser

Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the `JavaScript engine.`

## What can in-browser JavaScript do?

Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or the CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.

JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc.

`In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.`

For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:

Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.

React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.

Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).

Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
Remember the data on the client-side (“local storage”).

## What CAN’T in-browser JavaScript do?

JavaScript’s abilities in the browser are limited to protect the user’s safety. The aim is to prevent an evil webpage from accessing private information or harming the user’s data.

Examples of such restrictions include:

JavaScript on a webpage may not read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk, copy them or execute programs. It has no direct access to OS functions.

Modern browsers allow it to work with files, but the access is limited and only provided if the user does certain actions, like “dropping” a file into a browser window or selecting it via an input  tag.

There are ways to interact with the camera/microphone and other devices, but they require a user’s explicit permission. So a JavaScript-enabled page may not sneakily enable a web-camera, observe the surroundings and send the information to the NSA.

Different tabs/windows generally do not know about each other. Sometimes they do, for example when one window uses JavaScript to open the other one. But even in this case, JavaScript from one page may not access the other page if they come from different sites (from a different domain, protocol or port).

This is called the “Same Origin Policy”. To work around that, both pages must agree for data exchange and must contain special JavaScript code that handles it. We’ll cover that in the tutorial.

This limitation is, again, for the user’s safety. A page from http://anysite.com which a user has opened must not be able to access another browser tab with the URL http://gmail.com, for example, and steal information from there.

JavaScript can easily communicate over the net to the server where the current page came from. But its ability to receive data from other sites/domains is crippled. Though possible, it requires explicit agreement (expressed in HTTP headers) from the remote side. Once again, that’s a safety limitation.


## JS outside browser 

Historically, JavaScript was exclusively a client-side language, meaning it only ran inside a web browser. However, over the last two decades, it has evolved into a versatile language used in many environments outside the browser. This is made possible by standalone JavaScript engines and runtime environments.

The most prominent example is Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Google's V8 engine. Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript for:

Server-Side Applications: Building web servers, APIs, and other back-end services. This has made JavaScript a "full-stack" language.

Command-Line Tools: Creating scripts and utilities that can be run directly from the terminal.

Desktop Applications: Frameworks like Electron and NW.js use Node.js to build cross-platform desktop applications (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Slack).

Mobile Applications: Frameworks like React Native and NativeScript allow you to use JavaScript to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android.

Other environments and tools that use JavaScript outside the browser include databases like Apache CouchDB, which uses JavaScript for queries, and specialized engines for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The ability to run JavaScript anywhere a JavaScript engine is present has fundamentally changed its role, transforming it from a simple scripting language into a powerful, general-purpose tool.
